Folder for the study rooms project.
Study Room Finder feature:
-user can see how many time slots and study rooms are available for reservation in total and in each building
- 12:00AM Check Confirmed bookings to see who has booked already for day.

First get functionality down and then implement web interface using Flask

-Separate clem and mrc? Separate clem floors?

-Plan out front end (web interface). What does it look like? What will it do?

TODO:
-Fix navbar/check margins
-Implement show_availability function
-Base html? for about page

Goal of automating data collection for future analysis and model building:

data_mock.xlsx:
    -mock of dataset that will be constructed
    -an available time is a 30 minute time slot in a room
    -gather all available times across libraries and pct of total across all libs
    -gather individual library times both raw and as a pct of available rooms in library
    -plan is to automate data gathering every x minutes (undecided)
    -json will list the times available in specific rooms
        -rooms as keys: time slots as values
    -Add extra data about reservation such as purpose, class group, etc.

TODO:
- Add urls to each room
