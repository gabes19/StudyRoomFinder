# StudyRoomFinder

UVA Study Room Finder is a personal project aimed at simplifying the process of finding available study rooms at the University of Virginia and analyzing the supply and demand of study spaces throughout the semester. The increased movement on grounds during finals season at the University served as an inspiration to build a tool that could measure student behavior and library usage using study room availability as a proxy. UVA Study Room Finder makes the process of finding free space less frustrating. Choose the library you want to study at and get a list of all the rooms available for reservation that day on the "Home" page, or track the statistics on the "Analytics" page.

Built using Python (Flask), PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, and the Bulma CSS Framework, this project blends streamlined web development with robust data collection and analysis. Automated web scraping is handled via Selenium and BeautifulSoup, with periodic data capture scheduled through AWS Lambda. The system generates a growing dataset of study room availability, enabling exploration of supply and demand trends across different libraries by day, week, and semester.
