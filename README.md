# StudyRoomFinder

UVA Study Room Finder is a personal project aimed at simplifying the process of finding available study rooms at the University of Virginia and analyzing the supply and demand of study spaces throughout the semester. Inspired by movement on grounds during finals season at the University and all the time wasted looking for an isolated spot to sit down and study, UVA Study Room Finder makes the process of finding your space less frustrating. Choose the library you want to study at and get a list of all the rooms available for reservation that day.

Built using Python (Flask) and the Bulma CSS Framework, this project was built as a way blend streamlined web development and data collection and analysis techniques. Automated webscraping is done to create a dataset of room availiability data that explores the supply and demand of study rooms throughout the day, week, month, and semester.
