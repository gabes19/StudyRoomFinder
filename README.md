# StudyRoomFinder

UVA Study Room Finder is a personal project aimed at simplifying the process of finding and reserving study rooms at the University of Virginia. Inspired by the demanding nature of finals season at the University and all the time wasted looking for an isolated spot to sit down and study, UVA Study Room Finder makes the process of finding your space less frustrating. Choose the library you want to study at and get a list of all the rooms available for reservation that day.

Built using Python (Flask) and the Bulma CSS Framework, this project was built as a way to practice webscraping and fast, streamlined web development. There are plans to automate the webscraping and create a dataset of room availiability data to explore the supply and demand of study rooms throughout the day, week, month, and semester.
